### Knowledge gained from this project
Learned a whole lot doing this project, first pass with using Express.js, MongoDB, and Embedded JavaScript and what they are used for specifically! Learnt what a CRUD app is. Got to use a bunch of methods from each tool including, using request handlers to execute CRUD operations. Got a database up and running, connecting to the database within our server. Got to use a bunch of MongoDB collection methods including find, toArray, findOneAndUpdate, and more! Learned how template engines work and used the tooling to be able to display variable data using a for loop with Embedded JavaScript. Overall this project was huge in showing me the workflow of working in the backend.
